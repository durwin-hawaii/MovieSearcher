This is a DOTNET CORE project set up to run in a DOCKER container

If you have DOCKER installed simply run:

build.bat 
run.bat

build.bat builds the docker container
run.bat runs the docker container, currently listening on port 2438, you can change it to any port you want it to be.

Note: if running on linux chmod 777 build.bat and run.bat so it will be executable

You could open this project up in VisualStudio. When you run it VS will automatically open a browser to localhost:2438
